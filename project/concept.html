        <h1>Conceptual Document</h1>
        <p>The project will be called QikDrop. At its core, it is a file upload website.</p>
        <p>
            More specifically, the website is meant to be used as a way to quickly and efficiently
            upload files or text and later retrieve them with just as much ease. It will replace the
            current practice of firing up a new email, entering in your own address, attaching the info you want,
            sending it to yourself, and then later coming back to find it and its data. It can be thought as a Twitter
            meets Dropbox.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each user creates an account. When logged in, they can easily post a chunk of text and/or upload a file.
            Once done, the file will show up in a linear stream, sorted by date, of all the "drops" they have made.
            When they want to later access it again, they can do so by either logging in or simply visiting their personal
            URL. This URL will display their stream of drops, with their most recent drops at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is faster than email, doesn't require external hardware (USB, external HDD, etc), and is designed
            with browser use first, unlike products such as Dropbox.
