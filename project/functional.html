        <h1>Functional Specifications</h1>
        <p>
            This application was originally developed several years ago, in 2010. Since then though it has not been
            updated or brought inline with modern day browser capbilities. My proposal is to completely rewrite the
            application using new technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application will be split into a frontend and a backend. The frontend will use:
            <ul>
                <li>AngularJS (Javascript)</li>
                <li>Grunt</li>
                <li>LESS</li>
            </ul>

            The backend will use:
            <ul>
                <li>Laravel (PHP)</li>
                <li>MySQL</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The frontend will do zero server side processing and get all relevant data through AJAX requests to a
            REST API that the backend provides. The backend will behave as single source of truth, whereas the frontend
            will behave more or less as a 3rd party merely consuming the provided API. This gives the ability to easily
            expand this application to other platforms (iOS, Android, etc) without rewriting various database and
            request logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application contains 3 main pages:
            <ul>
                <li>Landing page (Registration and Login)</li>
                <li>Profile (Drop history)</li>
                <li>Account settings</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Landing Page</h3>
        <p>
            Here the user can login if they have an account, or they can create a new account with a username,
            email, and password. The username they use will also act as their personal URL. The user with the username
            "tyler" will have their page accessible at http://qikdrop.com/tyler. After logging in or creating a new
            account, they will be directed to their profile page.
        </p>
        <h3>Profile Page</h3>
        <p>
            This is where most of a user's actions are contained. On this page, a user is presented with a text box, a
            file upload input, and a linear stream. In this respect, it would look similar to Twitter's profile pages.
            A user can choose to upload a file and/or post a piece of text, whereas after it would be placed in the
            stream below. Here, they can also access a search box that will filter their stream based on their search
            term. Their drop stream will be a linear stack with their newest drops at the top. All profile pages are
            public by default. A user can also choose to delete individual drops from their account/stream with a
            single click. Other users can choose to report a user's drop with a single click if they deem it
            appropriate (Copywrite, illegal, etc).
        </p>
        <h3>Account Settings Page</h3>
        <p>
            This page will contain various user options:
            <ul>
                <li>Change your username</li>
                <li>Change your password</li>
                <li>Make your profile private</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            The current version of the website can be viewed at <a href="http://qikdrop.com">QikDrop.com</a>.
            The general layout of the new version will remain similar, but it will provide improved functionality
            such as better file upload handling, faster searches, etc. It will also be given a new color scheme and
            general design language.
